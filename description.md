# Description of submission

# Team members: Katya Ivanova, Mine Kuhn, Edoardo Constantini and Erwin Gielens
#
# Approach:
# We wanted to see how a theory-based approach would fare against 'pure' data-driven techniques. 
# (1) We select a set of indicators based on the literature on fertility transitions
#     and the expert knowledge of team members. 
# (2) Imputation with Mice performed by dr. Constantini
# (3) Predicted outcomes with a basic neural network (linear probability, 5 hidden layers, rprop+, no cross-validation)
